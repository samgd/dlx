# Ruby Dancing Links

## What is it?

> Dancing links, also known as DLX, is the technique suggested by Donald Knuth to
> efficiently implement his Algorithm X.
> [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links)

> "Algorithm X" is the name Donald Knuth used in his paper "Dancing Links" to
> refer to "the most obvious trial-and-error approach" for finding all solutions
> to the exact cover problem.

> ...
>
> The exact cover problem is represented in Algorithm X using a matrix A
> consisting of 0s and 1s. The goal is to select a subset of the rows so that
> the digit 1 appears in each column exactly once.
